The results:

Number of participants familiar with each language:

Go: 2

SQL: 6

Ruby: 4

Python: 1

Methods:

-Implemented Game of Life in multiple languages.

-Had SQL, Go, and Ruby codes evaluated by asking testers to go through with a form.

-Noted the observation in other sheets and had a correlation between them for the graphs.

Threats to Validity:

-Our data points were limited which may have slightly affected the accuracy of the data.
